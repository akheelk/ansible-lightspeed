# Project Wisdom FAQs

## What is Project Wisdom?

Project Wisdom is a service to enhance the creation of Red Hat Ansible automation.  Project Wisdom uses, among other data, Ansible roles and collections that are available through the community website, [Ansible Galaxy][galaxy]. The following provides some answers to questions you may have related specifically to Project Wisdom.

## Do you match Recommendations to Training Data?

Given the nature of deep learning technology, as well as the kinds of content used to train and which are generated by Wisdom, it is not possible to identify specific training data inputs that contributed to particular Wisdom output recommendations. Nevertheless, Wisdom includes a feature to help users that are interested in understanding possible origins of generated content recommendations. When Wisdom generates a recommendation, it will attempt to find items in the training dataset that closely resemble the recommendation. In such cases, Wisdom will display licensing information and a source repository link for the training data matches in a panel interface in the VS Code extension. Licensing information is determined using the [GitHub license API][gh-lince-api].

This feature may enable users to ascertain open source license terms that are associated with related training data. We have implemented this feature even though we believe it is unlikely that either the training data used in fine-tuning Wisdom or the Wisdom output recommendations themselves are generally protected by copyright, or that Wisdom output reproduces training data content controlled by copyright licensing terms.

## Does Red Hat assert rights in the suggestions generated by the Wisdom service?

Red Hat does not claim any copyright or other intellectual property rights in the suggestions generated by the Project Wisdom service.

## Is my final Ansible content created from the suggestions in VS Code editor used as feedback to the Wisdom service and may I opt out of providing feedback?

Project Wisdom is designed to be improved through feedback on the quality of its suggestions.  Technical details of user experiences with Wisdom can be useful in informing further improvements.  For example, identifying which Wisdom suggestions have been accepted by the user, noting particular details that the user has needed to adjust, etc.

This feedback is obtained by way of the Wisdom VS Code extension and is used to improve the Wisdom service. A VS Code extension setting enables a user to opt-out of contributing this feedback to the model.
