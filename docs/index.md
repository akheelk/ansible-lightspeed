# Project Wisdom Documentation

Project Wisdom is a joint project between IBM and Red Hat that offers access to Ansible content recommendations through the use of natural language automation descriptions.

Project Wisdom is currently in private preview.  During this phase, individuals that have expressed interest in participating will be invited to join the program over time.  This will allow Red Hat to monitor the service to tune its stability for a later release.  [Click here][project-wisdom] if you would like to join the Project Wisdom interest list.
